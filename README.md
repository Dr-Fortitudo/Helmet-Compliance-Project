## ü™ñ Helmet Compliance Detection üö®  
Keeping heads safe, one pixel at a time!

This project uses the power of YOLO object detection to make sure workers are actually wearing helmets ‚Äî not just claiming to. Detections runs every second, and violators are caught red-headed (well, helmet-less).

**üîç No Helmet? Sirens wail.**  
**üì∏ Caught in 4K? Image saved with timestamp.**  
**‚úÖ Wearing one? You‚Äôre good to go.**
