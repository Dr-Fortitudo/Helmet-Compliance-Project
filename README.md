## 🪖 Helmet Compliance Detection 🚨  
Keeping heads safe, one pixel at a time!

This project uses the power of YOLO object detection and a Raspberry Pi 4B to make sure workers are actually wearing helmets — not just claiming to. Snapshots are taken every 10 seconds, and violators are caught red-headed (well, helmet-less).

  ✅ Wearing one? You’re good to go.
